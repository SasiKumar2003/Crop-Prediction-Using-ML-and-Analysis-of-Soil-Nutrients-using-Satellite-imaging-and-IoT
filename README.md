This is the architecture used for crop prediction using ML.


# Dataset
The data used to train the model was collected from the Crop Prediction dataset. The dataset consists of 2200 samples of 22 different crops whose predictions are made using 7 features: nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and pH content of the soil, temperature, humidity and rainfall. The dataset is perfectly balanced, with each crop having 100 samples.
