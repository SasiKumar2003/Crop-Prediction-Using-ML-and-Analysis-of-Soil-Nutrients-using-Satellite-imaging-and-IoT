# Crop-Prediction-Using-ML-and-Analysis-of-Soil-Nutrients-using-Satellite-imaging-and-IoT
An Web Application developed using Streamlit to predict the suitable crop for a particular land. This is guessed by using Sentinal and Landsat images.

# Architecture used for crop prediction using ML.

# Architecture used for Analysis of Soil Nutrients using IOT.

# Architecture used for Satellite Imaging.

# Dataset
The data used to train the model was collected from the Crop Prediction dataset. The dataset consists of 2200 samples of 22 different crops whose predictions are made using 7 features: nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and pH content of the soil, temperature, humidity and rainfall. The dataset is perfectly balanced, with each crop having 100 samples.
